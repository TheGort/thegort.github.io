[**Independent Readings Course – Ethical Practice for Statisticians**]({{ site.url }}/assets/final_report.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Was one of three students selected to collaborate with Professor Liza Bolton on statistical ethics research, examining statistical misuse in science and media
* Authored a 9-page educative piece using **RMarkdown** to spread awareness of statistical literacy and ethics, and used **Zotero + BiBTeX** to manage references
* Conducted seminars and research presentations for cohort to synthesise findings and key ideas from a large range of sources

[**League of Legends Data Analysis – Smurf Detection & Ranked Progression**]({{ site.url }}/assets/lol_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Analyzed ranked match data using **R** (dplyr, ggplot2) to model rank progression and identify smurfing patterns for a school project.
- Cleaned and merged multi-source datasets from the Riot API, and explored relationships between rank, experience, total games played, and performance.
- Wrote a structured analytical report interpreting statistical results and visualizations for technical and non-technical audiences.

[**Statistical Analysis of Gender Parity (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Worked in a group of 4 for a school project as a consulting firm to assess gender parity in hiring, wages, and promotions for a fictitious software company
* Merged and wrangled large datasets to create data visualizations and summaries using **dplyr** and **ggplot2**
* Used judgment to choose appropriate generalized linear (mixed) models, checked their assumptions, and justified the selection in confidence intervals and significance testing
* Balanced the workload as a team and created a seamless report with reproducible code by using **RMarkdown**
* Liza Bolton (my past instructor for STA303) summarizes the project very well [**here:**](https://www.lizabolton.com/sta303_winter21_note){:target="_blank"}
