----
[**Independent Readings Course â€“ Ethical Practice for Statisticians**]({{ site.url }}/assets/final_report.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Was selected to be 1 of 3 students to explore the misuse of statistics in the scientific community and everyday media consumption
* Wrote a 9-page educative piece using **RMarkdown** to spread awareness of statistical literacy and ethics, and used **Zotero + BiBTeX** to manage references
* Conducted seminars and research presentations for cohort to synthesise findings and key ideas from a large range of sources

[**Statistical Analysis of Gender Parity (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Worked in a group of 4 for a school project as a consulting firm to assess gender parity in hiring, wages, and promotions for a fictitious software company
* Merged and wrangled large datasets to create data visualizations and summaries using **dplyr** and **ggplot2**
* Used judgment to choose appropriate generalized linear (mixed) models, checked their assumptions, and justified the selection in confidence intervals and significance testing
* Balanced the workload as a team and created a seamless report with reproducible code by using **RMarkdown**
* Liza Bolton (my past instructor for STA303) summarizes the project very well [**here:**](https://www.lizabolton.com/sta303_winter21_note){:target="_blank"}  

**League of Legends Data Analysis (R, Python)**
* Made a report trying to establish a relationship between rank in League of Legends and predictors such as total number of games played, wins, summoner level, etc. using linear regression
* Used Python libraries NumPy and pandas to extract and organize over 1000 entries from the Riot API, and used R to conduct regression analyses
* (The first version/attempt of my report has been completed, but I am refining the methods and procedures to make a second part.)

[**Report on the Effect of Mortality Rate and Alcohol Consumption Using RDD (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta304_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Individual school project aimed to replicate and extend Carpenter's and Dobkin's 2009 study on mortality rate and alcohol consumption
