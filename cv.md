## Projects 
#### (Please click the hyperlinks to view my work.)
----

[**Report on the Effect of Mortality Rate and Alcohol Consumption Using RDD (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta304_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Individual school project aimed to replicate and extend Carpenter's and Dobkin's 2009 study on mortality rate and alcohol consumption
* Applied linear and quadratic regression discontinuity methods, using minimum legal drinking age as the threshold
* Used **dplyr** and **tidyverse** to clean data, and **ggplot2** + **knitr** to visualize and present results.

[**Statistical Analysis of Gender Parity (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Worked in a group for a school project as a consulting firm to assess gender parity in hiring, wages, and promotions for a fictitious software company
* Used statistical inference to evaluate multiple generalized linear (mixed) models and checked assumptions where necessary
* Applied linear, logistic, and poisson regression to wrangled datasets in order to interpret summaries and confidence intervals
* Liza Bolton (my past instructor for STA303) summarizes the project very well [here:](https://www.lizabolton.com/sta303_winter21_note){:target="_blank"}  

**League of Legends Data Analysis (R, Python)**
* Made a report trying to establish a relationship between rank in League of Legends and predictors such as total number of games played, wins, summoner level, etc. using linear regression
* Used **Python's** **NumPy** and **pandas** libraries to extract and organize data, and **R** to conduct regression analyses.
* (The first version/attempt of my report has been completed, but I am refining the methods and procedures to make a second part.)

[**Data Visualization for COVID-19 Cases in Toronto (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_data-exploration_final.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Extensively used **tidyr** and **dplyr** libraries to wrangle, parse and transform real-time data from the City of Toronto website on COVID-19 cases in all 140 neighborhoods for a school assignment
* Used ggplot to visualize daily cases, outbreak types, and thematic maps that illustrate the percentage of low-income families and the proportion of COVID-19 cases by region

[**Comparing Complex Multiple Linear Models for Toronto and Mississauga House Prices (R)**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta302_a3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* Implemented multiple linear regression in order to help home buyers predict sale price of homes in the GTA for a school assignment
* Analyzed diagnostic plots and used the Akaike/Bayesian information criterion for optimal probabilistic model selection
