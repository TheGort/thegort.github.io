Hey! Thanks for taking the time to check me out.

&nbsp;

In summary, I am a new grad who is looking to learn more about the applications in the statistical sciences. I enjoy concepts such as regression analysis, probability theory, and ethical practice for statisticians. In the future, I hope to deepen this knowledge and use my skills to make the world a better place.

&nbsp;

My hobbies include video games, cinematography/video editing, and making people smile.

&nbsp;

I enjoy playing League of Legends, Stardew Valley, Teamfight Tactics, Valorant, and many other games [**(check out my Steam profile here)**](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thegortisthebestrightnow/){:target="_blank"}.
If you'd ever like to join my friends and I sometime, add me on Discord via TheGort#5051 (send me a message to let me know who you are first!).

&nbsp;

I also have a YouTube channel which you can check out [**here.**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaaYCWSM01Ke6LqG100zg0A){:target="_blank"}  
I haven't been posting as often as I'd like, but I hope to find the motivation to do so.  
You'll find that I upload all sorts of content, ranging from video games, educational videos, reviews, and skits.

&nbsp;

If anybody ever wondered what I listen to, follow me on [**Spotify.**](https://open.spotify.com/user/6r2g75pi5l7e863bglv83pzj9?si=CZbhiKIdRq2NqdZcS2SdHQ){:target="_blank"}  
I like listening to trap, pop, hip-hop, and k-pop every now and then.  
My favorite artists are Playboi Carti, Silk Sonic, and EXO.  
Favorite song right now: *Candy* by NCT Dream (originally by H.O.T).
