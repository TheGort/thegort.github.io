Hey all, I hope you're staying safe and healthy out there. After the New Year and Lunar New Year having gone by already, I haven't really made any resolutions. 

&nbsp;
 
I don't really believe in that tradition either since I eventually flake on my goals. That being said, creating this website and developing my relationships with people
suddenly gave me a huge urge to want to express myself better. I've always been hesitant to tell people about myself and how I feel (primarily because I feel like I'm
not that important), and while I think it will continue to remain like that, I want a space where I can freely convey my thoughts. 

&nbsp;

In summary, I'll try to write **one blog a day**, consisting of at least 100 words. Writing's important... right? I think it'll benefit me a lot. Furthermore, I'm going to try and pick up new hobbies when 
I have the time. I'm much busier than I thought, and I play it off all the time as if I'm not. It'll be difficult to change, but it's my job to do better.
