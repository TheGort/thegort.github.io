Not much to write about today, so I'll keep it short. I got crucified by two midterms, lost two games of Valorant, and lost two humiliating games of chess. Quite a defeating day.  
One good note is that including my midterms, I did about seven hours of work today and I did everything I had wanted to accomplish. Unfortunately, I have two more tomorrow so I don't really have a break... 
And I forgot to mention my short essay due on Friday. Oh no... As I'm writing this post, I feel sleepy. Well, all I can hope for is to do better tomorrow. Good night!
