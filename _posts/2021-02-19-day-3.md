I've been in a pensive, sad mood for the last little while. A permanent gust of melancholy whirls through the air around me because I feel like I've let everyone down. Not meeting someone's expectations and making them
unhappy are my biggest fears, and I've done just that. When you feel like you aren't enough, it hurts. Being surrounded constantly by people who are more sociable than you, smarter than you, stronger than you and 
better than you in every single way is such a toxic environment to be in. Know why? It's because you start _comparing yourself to them_, and you make yourself feel like shit. Why am I so stupid? Why am I so uninteresting
and boring? Why am I so weak, why am I so ugly, why am I awkward, why am I shy, why am I %^@#!#, why am I..., why am I `not enough`.

Damnit, I think too much.
