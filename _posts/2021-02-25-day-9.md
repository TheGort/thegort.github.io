Okay.

I've come to the realization that I fucked up way too much, and it needs to change now before the school semester starts going into rapidfire mode again. Also, these posts have become a bit too depressing; therefore,
I'm changing it up. This will be my game plan for tomorrow.

I am going to wake up at 9:30 AM, no doubt about it. I am so sick of waking up at 1 PM all the time. I will pop a melatonin as soon as I finish writing this blog post.

Next, I will get work done (after Genshin of course hehe). I have a quiz to write, an incomplete essay that needs to be finished and a few lectures I have to catch up on.  
In between this study period, **I will work out**. It has been 10 days since I've exercised, and I feel like crap. This is changing tomorrow.

When I complete all of this, I'm going to relax. That's when I know I've truly deserved the break. But overall, no more excuses and sitting around. 

Let's go.
