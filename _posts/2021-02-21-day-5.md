You guys might not believe it, but if I don't plan out what I want to do for the day, I just don't do anything at all. I feel like my life has been falling apart because I never did that during reading week. Did not give
a single damn. It doesn't matter if I plan the day of, or one day in advance, it just has to be done. I use Microsoft To-Do, a fairly standard productivity app. I write all the stuff I want/have to accomplish this week (or
even for the whole month), and then I divide them into micro-assignments for each day. It helps a lot when you simplify big, scary tasks into manageable/smaller ones. Furthermore, I log what I do by the hour just to ensure
I'm not slacking off. All this productivity shit might be extremely boring to a lot of people, but I promise you guys that a little bit of organization will turn your life around.
