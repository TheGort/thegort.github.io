Hey, long time no see.

&nbsp;

It seems like the daily blogs lasted for 10 days. I'm sort of disappointed in myself that I gave up, but at the same time, there are days where I have nothing to say.  
Forcing myself to type gibberish and balderdash didn't seem entertaining to me, so I think I'm going to make posts whenever I feel like expressing something.  
For the last little while, I've been trying to work on myself and get out of the rut that I was in: a constant state of slothfulness and gloom.  
I don't really know what's gotten into me lately, but I feel a bit better now.  
I've been working out for 30-60 minutes, getting 6+ hours of work done, and spending time with the people I love, every single day. Consistency is such a difficult habit to maintain, so I hope I find out the solution soon.  
Furthermore, I applied to a few jobs because I need to get off my ass and get some experience (we'll see how that goes).  
I quit reading Day of the Triffids because my God, that was boring. I need some more recommendations!

Anything else?... `yeah.`

To anyone reading this (well actually, to everybody in the world), I hope you're staying safe and remaining optimistic on the outlook of the world. I love you and I'll see you soon.
