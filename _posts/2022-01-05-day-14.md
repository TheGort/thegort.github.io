Happy New Year, everyone! I hope you all had a relaxing break, and are ready to start the year off strong. A lot has happened in 2021 and during the break I took in the second half of the year, but I'm prepared to 
actually change my life.  

&nbsp;

I've realized that there's something holding me back... something that I've wanted to make for a long time, and I hope that I can share that with you soon. There are just many things that haven't really been put together 
still, such as rigid discipline, consistency, a decent sleep schedule, motivation, and a lack of love for myself that are preventing me from working on what I love. I feel like I've had the same problem for years, 
but am not willing to do anything about it long-term. I just didn't care, especially last year. Throughout university, it's just been a sinusoidal trend of wanting to change for the better and not giving a shit. 
This desperately needs to go away.  

&nbsp;

I'm going to push as much as I can this year and fight the battle against myself. I'll keep you all posted, as I plan to return on the internet.

Thanks for reading, and I wish you the best with your struggles and goals.
