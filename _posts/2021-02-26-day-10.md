I finally broke the curse.

I logged 6 hours of work today, completed my essay, did my quiz, and watched some lectures. I didn't get to watch all the ones I had initially planned, but that's okay. It's Friday!

The best part? I worked out again. Man, it felt so good. I got weaker I think, but as long as I remain consistent from now on, it won't matter. I'm planning on taking jogs on my off days so that I'm at least on my feet
instead of sitting at my computer all day.

Tomorrow, I will continue watching lectures that I skipped out on, and study for my upcoming term test (man, they just keep on coming).

I feel a lot more content now that I've actually gotten some work done, but I'm still missing something. I feel incomplete, but what could it be?
