What am I doing...

I dropped a course, and it felt so good.

I ended up dropping STA452 (Mathematical Statistics) because I definitely was not prepared. I don't think I learned anything new from STA347 (after having taken STA257), so I felt like I was going to fail. I'll just take
it in fourth year like I'm supposed to. My original goal was trying to get ahead and relax next year, only needing to take eight classes instead of the usual 10. Looks like that isn't happening anymore. Ah, who cares.

Man, why is my life so demotivating. I want to upload videos and make people smile again, I want to work out again, I want to fix my sleep schedule, I want to be not sad.  
Sadly, I don't care enough.
