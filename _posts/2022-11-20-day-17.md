Hello, I'm back!

&nbsp;

It's been a while, as always! As you can probably tell, I'm still not the greatest person when it comes to consistency (sorry!).

&nbsp;

Ever since the last post, there's been some *great* news. I GOT A JOB!!!!!!!! Yes, you heard me right. I've been working as a data analyst at the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (super fancy name, I know).
It's an intergovernmental agency that serves as a forum to discuss and improve education across the country. I work with all 13 provinces and territories to update policies and modernize frameworks regarding
student financial assistance. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I couldn't be happier to work here. Shoutout to me...!

&nbsp;

Aside from that, life's been very good to me. I am very grateful to be able to make money and support my family, go to the gym regularly, hang out with friends and loved ones, and live life to the fullest.
Honestly, it seems like a window blind has opened and I can appreciate life just a little bit more. 

&nbsp;

If anyone would like to chat about life or anything they're going through, please let me know, seriously!
I love you all and I couldn't mean it enough. I'll keep you all updated (for real this time...?!).
