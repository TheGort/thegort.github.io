Waking up late is a pain in the ass. Sleeping in until 2 pm is the most demotivating thing in the world because your entire morning (and a part of your afternoon) is gone, you feel like crap because you haven't
gotten a single thing done yet, and intrinsically,you're late to the productivity race. If you guys haven't realized it yet, I slept in today. Now, I have to redeem myself and try to get back the hours I've lost. 
I don't workout because I'm behind on work, I hate myself because I haven't worked out in almost a week, and I hate myself because I hate myself.

Okay, this blog is starting to become a bit too negative. I am **actually** going to wake up early tomorrow. **No way** I sleep in again. I have four midterms and an essay this week, but I'm not giving up yet. Tomorrow
shall be a new day and I'll work harder than the last.

Maybe one game of Valorant first though...
