Hey, I hope you're not worried about me. Sorry I haven't been messaging you, I've been busy with school work and V. I have an assignment due on Sunday that I just started (don't ask me why!) and my personal website which
I hope you'll see some day. I also have a few more lectures I have to watch, so I need to finish that as well. If I'm being honest, I'm quite scared about next week; I have four midterms and an essay to do, but I think
I relaxed too much during reading week! Fear and anxiety always rush through me around these moments, but you already know I hate uncertainty. In any case, I hope you're doing well too. Make sure you're being healthy, getting
enough sleep and exercise, and be sure to give yourself some breaks! We're all very busy, so I can't have the opportunity to tell you this every day. Write back, so that I know you're here. Good night.
