The `days` fly by so fast, I can't even keep track of time anymore.  
I'm currently on reading week, but before I even knew it, it's already half way over. I didn't feel like I got much done, and I still have some school material to catch up on. I've been spending time with the people I care
about, which is nice, but it doesn't feel like I'm devoting my full attention towards them. I'm constantly juggling around work, hobbies, side projects, and off time, so there's always a feeling of disarray. Learning to
manage your time properly is important, and knowing when you can and can't commit to something is even more critical. As an example, with respect to my own life, taking six courses and trying to enjoy every `day` is a hard
challenge. Although it's a stimulating challenge, there are `days` where I can't take it. I've been finding it extremely difficult to just eat, and organizing my `day` has been demotivating.  
I ought to take a step back and reflect about it.

As a side note, I've started reading _Day of the Triffids_. 30 minutes before bed every `day` should be sufficient.
