I'm working on it. I'm working on myself, slowly but surely. Starting off the semester decently, applying to grad school, finding jobs, working out, establishing goals, learning every day, reading, and being a better
version of me. (That's all you've missed lately)  

&nbsp;

I can't promise you any future plans that I had in mind, so I will keep on pushing and work towards these plans, and update you when the time is right. Love you
