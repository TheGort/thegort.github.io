Hey folks, back in time just before the holidays. :)

&nbsp;

Not sure how often I should update this blog post since I'm unsure of how many people read these; nevertheless, I will write something if there's anything on my mind!

&nbsp;

Everything's been great though; work is chill, my life is chill, and I even got to conduct my own coffee chats outside of my old mentoring job! I honestly can't believe *I'm* the one that gets to give advice and inspire others.
It's honestly one of the best feelings in the world and I will give back to others as much I can.

&nbsp;

I don't really have much else to say besides the fact that there is a new 'Photos' section on my website where I will periodically add some of my favorite pictures in chronological order. I'm only using HTML, so if you have
any other recommendations on formatting, do let me know! Oh, and I hope to have something on my YouTube channel soon?... yea.

&nbsp;

Welp, see you in the next blog post!
